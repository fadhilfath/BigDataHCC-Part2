# NetApp

Brian McKean from NetApp presented to the class a data analysis problem he'd
like to get some help on.

# Overview

Listen to his presentation carefully. Write down the answers to the following
questions to show your team's understanding of the basics of the problem.

## What is the problem?

Can NetApp save money by using lower endurance flash?


## Why is the problem importnat?
Becuase when NetApp know how they system perform with the less expensive parts, then NetApp can reduce the cost of the system

## What dataset has been made available?
Controller, Date, FW Version, Release, SW Version, System serial number, Base time, Delta time, Observation time


## What specific questions are being raised?
What is the connection between release, FW version, SW version in terms of good and bad times?

# Q/A session

We will run a Q/A session. Before the session, compile a list of questions you
want to ask. Then, teams will take turn to ask Brian follow up questions.
Each team gets to ask one question each time. Write down the questions your team
wanted to ask and the answers you received. If another team happens to ask the
same question, simply write down the answer you heard.

## what not use technology based on customer usage?

## distribution of measure time, serial number vs delta time?

## how do you expect the system to perform?


# Approach

Based on the information you've obtained during the Q/A session, come up with
plan how your team will tackle this problem.

## How should the dataset be imported into Tableau?
import as a csv file


## How should the work be distributed among the team members?
Every person in the group come up with a question, and discuss that later on the team

## What types of charts or visualizations to use to support the answer?
We created the chart in terms of the good and bad delta time, and we can get the visualizations of the systems that have good delta times


## What questions may be too complex for Tableau and may require custom scripts to be written?
